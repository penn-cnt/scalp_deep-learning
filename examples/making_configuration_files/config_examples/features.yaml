# This file defines feature extraction steps as well as their keyword arguments.
# By externalizing the order, we can use reproducable code and allow individuals to comprehend/change the preprocessing steps quickly.
# This file can be called in the main.py file. Alternatively, the main body of the script can query the user for steps, then generate a similar file to this one with user specified filename.
